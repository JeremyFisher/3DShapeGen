# 3D Reconstruction of Novel Object Shapes from Single Images
This repository consists of the code for rendering, training and evaluating our novel method SDFNet as well as baseline method [Occupancy Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.03828.pdf) in [3D Reconstruction of Novel Object Shapes from Single Images](link-to-pub). Code to repoduce results for baseline method [GenRe](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7494-learning-to-reconstruct-shapes-from-unseen-classes.pdf) can be found [here](https://github.com/devlearning-gt/GenRe-ShapeHD).

## Rendering
